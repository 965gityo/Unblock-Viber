# Unblock Viber – Recovering a Blocked or Compromised Viber Account

This repository documents the process of recovering a Viber account that was blocked after being compromised. If you're facing a similar issue—like losing access to your account due to suspicious activity—this guide may help.

## 📖 Background

In early 2024, my wife's Viber account was compromised. Shortly afterward, she was unable to log in, and the account appeared to be blocked. This repository shares the recovery steps we took in the hopes that others in the same situation will find it useful.

## 🚨 Symptoms of a Blocked Account

- Error message when logging in:  
  _"This account has been blocked."_  
  _"This number is no longer available on Viber."_
- Inability to receive verification codes.
- Sudden account deactivation with no prior warning.
